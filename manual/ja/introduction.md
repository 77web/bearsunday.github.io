# Introduction

## What is BEAR.Sunday ?

This resource orientated framework has both externally and internally a REST centric architecture, implementing **Dependency Injection** and **Aspect Orientated Programming** heavily to offer you surprising simplicity, order and flexibility in your application.

With very few components of its own, it is a fantastic example of how a framework can be built using existing components and libraries from other frameworks, yet offer even further benefit and beauty.

## Resource Orientated Framework

In BEAR.Sunday everything is a REST resource which leads to far simpler design and extensibility. Interactions with your database, services and even pages and sections of your app all sit comfortably in a resource which can be consumed or rendered at will.

### Everything is a resource

The above diagram illustrates how the resource object works.

# Packages

BEAR.Sunday application framework consists packages of three type. **Independent packages** which are available in [Packagist](https://packagist.org/)
. **Ray packages** are DI and AOP object framework. **BEAR.* packages** organize as a application framework with former two packages.

## BEAR.* packages

### BEAR.Resource ⊂ BEAR.Sunday ⊂ BEAR.Package

[BEAR.Resource](https://github.com/koriym/BEAR.Sunday) is a **hypermedia framework** that allows resources to behave as objects.
It allows objects to have RESTful web service benefits such as client-server, uniform interface, statelessness, resource expression with mutual connectivity and layered components.

[BEAR.Sunday](https://github.com/koriym/BEAR.Sunday) is a collections of abstractions to form BEAR.Resource as an application framework.
Such as annotations, exceptions or interfaces. It has almost no actual implementations.

[BEAR.Package](https://github.com/koriym/BEAR.Package) supply bindings for BEAR.Sunday abstractions to actual implementations, such as Aura libraries or Symfony components.
It organizes a web application framework with application scripts and development tools.

## Ray DI/AOP packages

BEAR.Sunday uses universally across the framework the Dependency Injection(DI) pattern and Aspect Orientated Programming (AOP).
With the benefit of being able to use annotations to inject dependencies it uses the [Ray.Di](https://github.com/koriym/Ray.Di)[Ray.Aop](https://github.com/koriym/Ray.Aop) framework which is a PHP clone of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Guice Google Guice].
AOP in BEAR.Sunday uses the interface settled upon by the [http://aopalliance.sourceforge.net/ AOP Alliance] implemented in PHP. Being able to bind multiple cross-cutting concerns to a specific method by using annotations or naming conventions.
In dynamic languages DI/AOP introduction can bring in performance concerns.
However in BEAR.Sunday with loose coupling and a high level of abstraction, using a created dependencies injected application cached object graph has next to no affect on performance.

## Framework Organization

The framework package (BEAR.Package) directory structure looks like this:

```
{$PACKAGE_DIR}
├── apps                     # applications
│   ├── Demo.Helloworld
│   └── Demo.Sandbox

```
