# My First Resource Request

## Using the Application Resource 

Until not in the tutorial we have been using the console or web browser to request resources, in this tutorial we will make a resource request from another resource.

We will change the page we made in <a href="my_first_web_page.html">My First Web Page</a> to use the resource we made in [my_first_resource My First Resource].
The page resource will request an application resource.
The page resource is a resource primarily concerned with a page.
Normally a page resource will request all of the necessary application resources in order to compose them together within itself.

 Note: For example a page that the controller returns 'Hello World' to, changes into a page that the model returns 'Hello World'.

## Resource Client Preparation 

In BEAR.Sunday the necessary services (object) fundamentally expects everything to be injected externally. 
In a resource request we need a resource client.
Using the type hinted Resource client interface （`BEAR\Resource\ResourceInterface`） and mark using the`@Inject` annotation we can have it injected for us (external assignment).

{% highlight php startinline %}
<?php
use BEAR\Resource\ResourceInterface;
use Ray\Di\Di\Inject;

class User
{
    /**
     * @Inject
     */
    public function setResource(ResourceInterface $resource)
    {
        $this->resource = $resource;
    }
{% endhighlight %}

## Using the Trait Setter 
This setter can be used via a trait as in the example below.

{% highlight php startinline %}
<?php
use BEAR\Sunday\Inject\ResourceInject;

class User
{
    use ResourceInject;
}
{% endhighlight %}

## GET Request

A method that makes a resource request to an application resource with a URI `app://self/first/greeting` and appended query string '?name=$name' looks like this.

{% highlight php startinline %}
<?php
    /**
     * @param  string $name
     */
    public function onGet($name = 'anonymous')
    {
        $this['greeting'] = $this->resource
            ->get
            ->uri('app://self/first/greeting')
            ->withQuery(['name' => $name])
            ->request();
        
        return $this;
    }
{% endhighlight %}

Here we assign `request` to `greeting` slot, not a value. If we add `eager` clause,
Then that request was evaluate and assign as value.

## **$_GET** Query

The contents of `$_GET['name']` is passed to the variable `$name`.
When `$_GET['name']` doesn't exist 'anonymous' is passed in.

## Checking the Page with the Command Line 

The resource request is stored in the 'greeting' slot `'app://self/first/greeting'`.

## Check as an API 

Lets check the page resource as an API.

```
$ php api.php get 'page://self/first/greeting?name=BEAR'
```

```
200 OK
cache-control: no-cache
date: Fri, 13 Jul 2012 13:47:28 GMT
content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
[BODY]
greeting:Hello, BEAR
```

**Hello, BEAR** is passed into the greeting slot. If we remove the query what happens ?

```
$ php api.php get 'page://self/first/greeting'
```

```
200 OK
content-type: ["application\/hal+json; charset=UTF-8"]
cache-control: ["no-cache"]
date: ["Mon, 12 Nov 2012 01:32:07 GMT"]
[BODY]
{
    "greeting": "Hello, anonymous",
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "page://self/first/greeting"
        }
    }
}
```

We have been able to check that the default value has been injected.

## Page Template Preparation 

The template for the page resource is also the same.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <body>
      <h1>{$greeting}</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Check the HTML through the Command Line 

```
$ cd {$PROJECT_ROOT}/apps/Sandbox/var/www
$ php dev.php get '/first/greeting?name=Sunday'
```

```
200 OK
...
cache-control: ["no-cache"]
date: ["Sun, 13 Oct 2013 19:50:11 GMT"]
[BODY]
greeting app://self/first/greeting?name=Sunday

[VIEW]
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
<h1>Hello, Sunday</h1>
</body>
</html>

```

We can see the resource view as well as resource value. We can confirm `greeting` slot has request with underlined URI.
This request was evaluated on appearance in view. In this case both has no difference,
but you may want to have a lazy request because the resource appearance will be changed in condition.

## Testing The Page 
The page is also a resource. The method of testing these is the same as testing page resources covered in <a href="my_first_test.html">My First Test</a>
