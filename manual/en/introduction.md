## What is BEAR.Sunday ?

This resource orientated framework has both externally and internally a REST centric architecture, implementing **Dependency Injection** and **Aspect Orientated Programming** heavily to offer you surprising simplicity, order and flexibility in your application.

With very few components of its own, it is a fantastic example of how a framework can be built using existing components and libraries from other frameworks, yet offer even further benefit and beauty.

## Resource Orientated Framework

In BEAR.Sunday everything is a REST resource which leads to far simpler design and extensibility. Interactions with your database, services and even pages and sections of your app all sit comfortably in a resource which can be consumed or rendered at will.
